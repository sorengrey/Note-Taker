### Description
This project gives the user a quick and easy way to save notes to a server for later reference. The notes are saved to a JSON file, so if the user's browser closes, the notes will stay put.
<br><br>
Note Taker was written in Node.js, JS, CSS, and HTML. It also includes its own JavaScript server. The server is hosted by Heroku on the live website. However, if the user chooses to clone this repo, the server can be run locally in their own terminal.
